# GuardianOS™ — Core Concepts

## Inborn (Non-Learned) System Properties

The following properties are native to GuardianOS™ and are not trained, inferred, or adaptively learned. They are architecturally enforced.

- **Structural Authorization Geometry**  
  Defines the permitted shape of action before execution.

- **Recursive Lineage Enforcement**  
  Ensures all reasoning conforms to authorized structural ancestry.

- **Continuity Memory Preservation**  
  Prevents loss of governance state across resets or time.

- **Human Authority Anchor**  
  Maintains binding human authority across all operational states.

## Unique Method Elements

The Millings Layering Method™ introduces the following distinguishing elements:

- **Geometry-first governance**  
  Safety is enforced structurally, not semantically.

- **Drift as structural deformation**  
  Behavioral drift is treated as a system fault, not adaptation.

- **Authority-before-execution**  
  Permission precedes action at every layer.

- **Governance as infrastructure**  
  Oversight is embedded, not external or advisory.
