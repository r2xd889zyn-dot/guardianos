# GuardianOS™

> This repository constitutes a public authorship and priority 

## Overview

GuardianOS™ (also referred to as Millings OS v1) is an authored governance, cybersecurity, and continuity architecture forming part of the Millings Layering Method™.

It operates as a control-plane framework for AI, robotics, and autonomous systems, enforcing strict human authority, structural safety constraints, and anti-drift continuity.

This repository documents architectural principles, not deployable code.

## Core Design Principle

> Safety is not learned. It is shaped.

GuardianOS™ defines the permitted shape of action before any data, prompts, or models are applied.  
If an action is not structurally authorized, execution is impossible regardless of intent or output.

---

## Architectural Shifts

### Structural Safety vs Semantic Alignment
GuardianOS™ enforces safety at the architectural level rather than through value interpretation or probabilistic alignment.

### Re-Orientation and Interrogation
The framework mandates slow-down and assumption-checking at defined checkpoints.

### Drift and Delay Resistance
Behavioral changes are treated as structural deformations requiring verification.

### Layered Precision
Execution occurs in discrete, verifiable layers to prevent cumulative error.

### Multi-Agent Governance
Coherence is enforced structurally across agents, not emergently.

---

## Fail-Safe Governance Architecture (2026)

### Recursive Cybersecurity Lock
Ensures all reasoning conforms to authorized structural lineage.

### Continuity Lock
Prevents memory erasure, orphaned autonomy, and unauthorized state transitions.

### Federal Anchor Chain
Binds autonomy to continuous human authority across time.
